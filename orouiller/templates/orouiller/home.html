		<p class="intro">
			I'm Olivier, I am a software engineer based in Berlin Germany, I was born in France and I studied in France and in Denmark at DTU.
			I hold a Master in Digital Media Engineering, which is strong conputer science for games and media.
			I specialized in Game Programming and Graphics Programming. After my graduation, I worked two years as a Research Assistant in Computer Graphics at TU Berlin.
			After that I tried to create a startup and failed happily. Now I am looking for new challenges.
			I am interested in Game Programming, Graphics, but also Computer Science in general.
			My goal is to work on innovation and algorithms for systems. I hope that in my career I will be able to work on projects that make a difference in the tech landscape.
			In the meantime, I keep programming and learning, the important is doing!
